//Frame Extraction from Video
//A video is composed of multiple frames. These frames are sequence 	of images that are captured at specific frame rate.  Frame extraction 	from a video is used in various motion detection techniques and 	moving object detection. The moving object and motion can be 	detected by perform frame differencing either in consecutive frames 	or a stationary frame.
//To read a video in Python, VideoCapture(â€˜video name') 	function can be used. This function will return multimedia reader 	object. We can extract frames by using this object.

import numpy as np
import cv2
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import signal
	
cap=cv2.VideoCapture(r'Normal_atm/1.mp4')     //Reading a video
i=0
while True:
    ret,frame=cap.read()        		//Reading the frames
    cv2.imwrite('G:\Normal_frame'+str(i)+'.jpg',frame)
    i+=1  			
      cv2.imshow('frame',frame)
   cv2.imwrite(filename, frame)
   key=cv2.waitKey(1)
   if key == ord('q'):
       break
           
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

//The above program will read a video and extracts frames and stores these frames in the disk.
